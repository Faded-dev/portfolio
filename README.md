        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Joseph Adesewa Inioluwa, a passionate and detail-oriented Virtual Assistant and Front-End Developer with a growing background in Product Management. I currently work with Hinansho and Ayilara Sodiq as a reliable assistant, helping to streamline operations and communication. With strong skills in HTML and CSS and budding knowledge of JavaScript, I design visually appealing websites and build customized portfolios for individuals at affordable rates.
            <br><br>
            My journey started as a Computer Science student at the University of Ilorin, and I've since gained hands-on experience working with Travric as a Front-End Developer and interning at Vergold for six months. My passion for excellence, organization, and creative design shines through in everything I do.
            <br><br>
            Whether it's managing tasks, creating digital products, or coding elegant interfaces, I deliver with dedication and heart. I believe in smart, beautiful work that makes life easier—and that's what I bring to every project.
